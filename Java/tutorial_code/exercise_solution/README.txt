Please note that in order to compile and run 
mini-exercise 3 and the main exercises 7-9 you
will need to set your CLASSPATH environment 
variable to point to the directory containing 
the gensim directory.  Instructions on how to
do this are provided in the Local Information
document bundled in with the exercise 
descriptions.
